Testing Field Notes Following a Prerelease Build of iOS or New Build on Staging Server
=======================================================================================

Please follow the steps below to check that the Field Notes website and app are working as they should. Ultimately, the idea of this test is to check, after a prerelease build of iOS or a new build on the staging server, that the basic functionality works. What we are looking for is the following: 

- That you can create a task
- You can upload from the app to a task
- You can stop an upload half way through and it will store the information uploaded so far. When   you continue the upload, it will do so from the point that it was disrupted.
- That you can see multiple tasks on the app. 

Set up a Task on Website
------------------------
1. Log into dashboard (Jump to step eight if you are already a community member)
2. Click ‘Projects’
3. Click 'all projects' in dropdown
4. Click 'test project'
5. Click 'edit' on community members
6. Scroll to bottom of page and 'add community member'
7. Click 'done' when completed to return to 'all projects'
8. Click 'test project'
9. Click a 'new task'
10. Create a new test task, this will be used to test the app in staging.
11. Fill in the minimum information (the title, description and deadline fields are all required). Try and have a two line description to make sure this represents itself correctly in the app 
12. Click 'edit assignments'
13. Assign yourself to the task
14. Publish the task. To find your log in code (in order to log in) go back to 'test project' in breadcrumbs, click on 'community members', and click your name. You will then see an invitation code in the top left hand corner that you can use to log in to the app. 

Test Existing Task in App and on Webpage
----------------------------------------

1. IN MOBILE DEVICE - Go to app
2. IN APP - Type 'staging' in both user name and password. This will give you access to the staging site. 
  1. You will be faced with the log in page again. This time put in your username and the invitation code. 
  2. You will now have reached the home page. You should see the take you have created. click on this task.
  3. This will take you into your task. Is the description there as you wrote it? Is the deadline correct? Can you see a button to send messages? Are the write, photo, video and audio buttons there?
 Test each of the input buttons. starting with write, you should see a text editing page. Type some text in and press add. It should take you to the task page. You should see your text  below and the input icons will now be shown horizontally on a bar at the bottom of the screen. 
3. ON WEBPAGE - Go to your assignment. Check that is has started. You should see the text within this. 
4. IN APP - Repeat the task for the photo, video and audio. You can do all of these simultaneously to save time. 
5. IN MOBILE DEVICE - Check it is uploading, pausing and resuming in the assignment by doing the following. In photo, once you have uploaded your image, go to settings and check 'flight safe’ mode. 
6. IN APP - Check that the app has paused the upload
7. ON WEBPAGE - Check this is registering the upload, and it has paused
8. IN MOBILE DEVICE - Turn off flight safe mode, go to the app and resume the upload. Has the upload continued? 
9. ON WEBPAGE - Hit refresh and check that is has uploaded all inputs to the task.
